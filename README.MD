# DG Bubbles for M.U.G.E.N

This is another MUGEN project I started back in 2010 (See the ReadmeOld.txt if you want more info). It's basically an edit of 007's old Bubbles character, fully optimized with better AI and moves... in addition to Mortal Kombat style moves because I could, at least back then. I barely even made progress with this character since the last time I made changes to her, but hopefully that'll change soon.

This character is currently in its beta stage.

Feel free to report any bugs in the issues tab and leave any suggestions with regards to what features you want in the character.

# How to Install

Click on "Clone or Download" and click on the Download ZIP option. Then, extract it into the chars folder of your root MUGEN folder. The ZIP file should come in its own folder and you'll want to be sure that the folder name itself is the same as the .def file. Otherwise, it will NOT show up on your roster.
